## Project Layout

  * /assets - application media assets (images, app icons, video)
  * /src - JavaScript source files. Flux (Reflux) architecture:
  	* /actions - helper functions that pass data to the dispatcher and api services to fetch data
    * /components - modular components of pages
    * /stores - store application state and logic, similar to model in MVC
    * /views - page views
  * /styles - src (less, scss, sass) stylesheets, styles for individual components should be broken out and put in the components folder. They can be included in the build using an @import statement
